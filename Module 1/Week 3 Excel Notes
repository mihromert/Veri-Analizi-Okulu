to split the birthdate:
=TEXTSPLIT(P2,"/")

to build a new column:
=TEXTJOIN(".",TRUE,Q2,R2,S2)

for example, if we want to create mail adresses from name and surname column:
=LOWER(LEFT(U2,7))

naming automatically:
=SEQUENCE(24,,3,1)
OR for dates:
=SEQUENCE(24,,DATE(2025,10,22),7)

getting commision for each selling:
=J2*10

finding some data:
=XLOOKUP(Key,where we search,return)

pivot tables: we can creat our sub table that includes automated results such as the 'max' or 'avg' of given data by columns or rows
